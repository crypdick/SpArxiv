1801_00729.tex," The collective excitation  of  surface plasmons in a massless Dirac plasma (e.g., graphene) half-space (bounded by air) is investigated using a relativistic quantum fluid model. The unique features of such surface waves are discussed and compared with those in a Fermi plasma. It is found that in contrast to Fermi plasmas, the long-wavelength surface plasmon frequency $(\omega)$  in massless Dirac plasmas is explicitly nonclassical, i.e.,  $\hbar$ , where $h=2\pi\hbar$  is the Planck's constant. Besides some apparent similarities between the surface plasmon frequencies in massless Dirac plasmas and Fermi plasmas, several notable differences are also found and discussed. Our findings elucidate the properties of surface plasmons that may propagate in degenerate plasmas  where the relativistic and quantum effects play a vital role. "
1801_08725_2317.tex," Stimulated by the renewed observation of $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ signal and its updated mass value $(2318.3MeV/c^{2}$ in the process $e^{+}e^{-}s^{*+}D_{s0}^{*}(2317)^{-}+c.c.$ by BESIII Collaboration, we devote to reinvestigate $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ as a $0^{+}$ tetraquark state from QCD sum rules. Technically, four different possible currents are adopted and high condensates up to dimension $12$ are included in the operator product expansion (OPE) to ensure the quality of QCD sum rule analysis. In the end, we obtain the mass value $2.37^{+0.50}_{-0.36}~GeV$ for the scalar-scalar current, which agrees well with the experimental data of $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ and could support its explanation as a $0^{+}$ scalar-scalar tetraquark state. The final result for the axial-axial configuration is calculated to be $2.51^{+0.61}_{-0.43}~GeV$ , which is still consistent with the mass of $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ considering the uncertainty, and then the possibility of $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ as a axial-axial tetraquark state can not be excluded. For the pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar and the vector-vector cases, their unsatisfactory OPE convergence makes that it is of difficulty to find rational work windows to further acquire hadronic masses. "
1801_08646_Information-tree-datamatrix1_25_18.tex," Phylogenetic trees in genetics and biology in general are all binary. We make an attempt to answer one fundamental question: Is such binary branching from the coarsest to the finest scales sustained by data? We convert this question into an equivalent one: where is the structural information of tree in a data matrix? Results from this conceptual as well as computing issue afford us to conclude a negative answer: Each branch being split into two at each inter-node of tree from the top to bottom levels is a man-made structure. The data-driven computing paradigm Data Mechanics is employed here to reveal that information of tree is composed of a set of selected temperatures (or scales), each of which has a clustering composition strictly regulated by a temperature-specific cluster-sharing probability matrix. The resultant Data Cloud Geometry (DCG) tree on the space of species is proposed as the authentic structure contained in data. Particularly each core clusters on the finest scale, the bottom level, of DCG tree should not be further partitioned because of uniformity. Beyond the finest scale, the branching of DCG tree is primarily based on probability, which induces an Ultrametric satisfying super triangular inequality property. This Ultrametric property differentiates DCG tree from all popular trees based on Hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithm, which typically employs an empirical, often ad hoc distance measure. Since this measure is regulated by the triangular inequality, it is not capable of producing a ``flat"" branch, in which all its members (more than two) have equal distances to each others. We demonstrate such information content on an illustrative zoo data first, and then on two genomic data. 	"

1801_06947.tex," Let $r$ and $n$ be positive integers, let $G_n$ be the complex reflection group of $n \times n$ monomial matrices whose entries are $r^{th}$ roots of unity and let $0 \leq k \leq n$ be an integer. Recently, Haglund, Rhoades and Shimozono ( $r=1$ ) and Chan and Rhoades ( $r>1$ ) introduced quotients $R_{n,k}$ (for $r>1$ ) and $S_{n,k}$ (for $r \geq 1$ ) of the polynomial ring $\CC[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ in $n$ variables, which for $k=n$ reduce to the classical coinvariant algebra attached to $G_n$ . When $n=k$ and $r=1$ , Garsia and Stanton found an explicit isomorphism between the coinvariant algebra and a quotient of $\CC[\yy_S]$ , the polynomial ring in $2^n-1$ variables whose variables are indexed by nonempty subsets $S \subseteq [n]$ .

1801_09727_main.tex," We present a classical model for high harmonic generation during the propagation of an intense laser pulse through an atomic gas. Numerical simulations of the model show excellent quantitative agreement with the corresponding quantum model for the blueshift and intensity reduction of the propagating laser pulse over experimentally realistic propagation distances. Furthermore, phase-space analysis of the classical model uncovers the mechanism behind an intriguing feature of the quantum high-harmonic spectrum: a significant extension of the high-harmonic cutoff beyond the $3.17U_p+I_p$ cutoff law.

1801_08369_vs6.tex," Vibrational spectroscopy has been widely employed to unravel physical-chemical properties of biological systems. Due to its high sensitivity to monitor real time ""in situ"" changes, Raman spectroscopy has been successfully employed, e.g., in biomedicine, metabolomics, and biomedical engineering. The grounds of interpretation of Raman spectra in these cases is the isolated macromolecules constituent vibrational assignment. Due to this, probe the anharmonic interactions or the mutual interactions among specific moieties/side chains to name but a few is a challenge. We present a complete vibrational modes calculation for connective tissue in the fingerprint region ( $800-1800$ cm $^{-1}$ ) using first-principles Density Functional Theory. Our results indicated that important spectral features correlated to molecular characteristics have been ignored within the usual tissue spectral bands assignments. In particular, we found that the presence of confined water is the main responsible for the observed spectral complexity. Our calculations accounted for the inherent complexity of the spectral features in this region and useful spectral markers for biological processes were unambiguously identified. "
1801_01080_ID600.tex," %A novel deep neural network training paradigm that exploits the conjoint information in multi-modal features arising from heterogeneous sources is proposed. In a RGB-D based action recognition task, it cooperatively trains a single convolutional neural network (named c-ConvNet) on both RGB visual features and depth features, and deeply aggregates the two kinds of features for action recognition. Differently from the conventional ConvNet that learns the deep separable features for homogeneous modality-based classification with only one softmax loss function, the c-ConvNet enhances the discriminative power of the deeply learned features and weakens the modality discrepancy by jointly optimizing a ranking loss and a softmax loss for both homogeneous and heterogeneous modality-based action recognition. The ranking loss consists of intra-modality and cross-modality triplet losses, and it reduces both the intra-modality and cross-modality feature variations. Furthermore, knowledge about the correlations between RGB and depth data are incorporated in the c-ConvNet, and enables the use as additional depth information for the case where only RGB information is available. The proposed method was extensively evaluated on three RGB-D action recognition datasets, two large sets, ChaLearn LAP IsoGD and NTU RGB+D datasets, and a small set, SYSU 3D HOI dataset, and achieved state-of-the-art results.

1801_08977_3D-BTW.tex," The BTW sandpile model is considered on three dimensional percolation lattice which is tunned with the occupation parameter $p$ . Along with the three-dimensional avalanches, we study the energy propagation in two-dimensional cross-sections. We use the moment analysis to extract the exponents for two separate cases: the critical ( $p=p_c3D$ ) and the off-critical ( $p_c<p\leq 1$ ) cases. The three-dimensional avalanches at $p=p_c$ has exponents like the regular 2D BTW model, whereas the exponents for the 2D cross-sections have serious similarities with the 2D critical Ising model. The moment analysis show that finite size scaling theory is the fulfilled, and some hyper-scaling relations are confirmed. For the off-critical lattice, the exponents change logarithmically with $p-p_c$ , for which the cut-off exponents $\nu$ drop discontinuously from $p=p_c$ to the other values. The analysis for the 2D cross-sections show a singular behavior at some $p_02D$ ( $p_c^{3D}$ and $p_c^{2D}$ being three- and two-dimensional percolation thresholds). We argue that there are two separate phases in the cross-sections, namely $p_c^{3D}2D$ which, due to lack of 2D percolation cluster, has no thermodynamic limit, and $p2D$ having the chance to involve percolated clusters.

1801_01429_ms.tex," For any free oriented Borel-Moore homology theory $A$ , we construct an associative product on the $A$ -theory of the stack of Higgs torsion sheaves over a projective curve $C$ . We show that the resulting algebra $AHa_C^0$ admits a natural shuffle presentation, and prove it is faithful when $A$ is replaced with usual Borel-Moore homology groups. We also introduce moduli spaces of stable triples, heavily inspired by Nakajima quiver varieties, whose $A$ -theory admits an $AHa_C^0$ -action. In particular, we obtain an action of $AHa_C^0$ on the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of points on $T^*C$ . "
1801_08671_FBPC_Myoung_ACSPhoton.tex," We investigate the optical properties of a photonic crystal composed of a quasi-one-dimensional flat-band lattice array through finite-difference time-domain simulations. The photonic bands contain flat bands (FBs) at specific frequencies, which correspond to compact localized states as a consequence of destructive interference. The FBs are shown to be nondispersive along the $\Gamma\rightarrow X$ line, but dispersive along the $\Gamma\rightarrow Y$ line. The FB localization of light in a single direction only results in a self-collimation of light propagation throughout the photonic crystal at the FB frequency. "
1801_09956_VolatilityMCMC3.tex," Given discrete time observations over a fixed time interval, we study a nonparametric Bayesian approach to estimation of the volatility coefficient of a stochastic differential equation. We postulate a histogram-type prior on the volatility with piecewise constant realisations on bins forming a partition of the time interval. The values on the bins are assigned an inverse Gamma Markov chain (IGMC) prior. Posterior inference is straightforward to implement via Gibbs sampling, as the full conditional distributions are available explicitly and turn out to be inverse Gamma. We also discuss in detail the hyperparameter selection for our method. Our nonparametric Bayesian approach leads to good practical results in representative simulation examples. Finally, we apply it on a classical data set in change-point analysis: weekly closings of the Dow-Jones industrial averages. "
1801_04577_DSFD2017.tex," Cascaded or central-moment-based lattice Boltzmann method (CLBM) is a relatively recent development in the LBM community, which has better numerical stability and naturally achieves better Galilean invariance for a specified lattice compared with the classical single-relation-time (SRT) LBM. Recently, CLBM has been extended to simulate thermal flows based on the double-distribution-function (DDF) approach [L. Fei et al., Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer 120, 624 (2018)] . In this work, CLBM is further extended to simulate thermal flows involving complex thermal boundary conditions and/or a heat source. Particularly, a discrete source term in the central-moment space is proposed to include a heat source, and a general bounce-back scheme is employed to implement thermal boundary conditions. The numerical results for several canonical problems are in good agreement with the analytical solutions and/or numerical results in the literature, which verifies the present CLBM implementation for thermal flows.

1801_02990_jpp2esam.tex," Using Stokes flow between eccentric counter-rotating cylinders as a prototype for bounded nearly parallel lubrication flow, we investigate the effect of a slender recirculation region within the flow field on cross-stream heat or mass transport in the important limit of high P e clet number \Pen \ where the enhancement over pure conduction heat transfer without recirculation is most pronounced. The steady enhancement is estimated with a matched asymptotic expansion to resolve the diffusive boundary layers at the separatrices which bound the recirculation region. The enhancement over pure conduction is shown to vary as $\frac{1{2}}$ at infinite \Pen, where $\frac{1{2}}$ is the characteristic width of the recirculation region. The enhancement decays from this asymptote as $\Pen\smh$ . "
1801_09718_main.tex," Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a novel problem domain where multi-modal inputs must be processed in order to solve the task given in the form of a natural language. As the solutions inherently require to combine visual and natural language processing with abstract reasoning, the problem is considered as AI-complete. Recent advances indicate that using high-level, abstract facts extracted from the inputs might facilitate reasoning. Following that direction we decided to develop a solution combining state-of-the-art object detection and reasoning modules. The results, achieved on the well-balanced CLEVR dataset, confirm the promises and show significant, few percent improvements of accuracy on the complex ""counting"" task. "
1801_07429_ms.tex," This paper statistically investigates the properties of \CIV \ and \MgII \ narrow absorption lines (NALs) to look for velocity cuts that can well constrain quasar-associated NALs. The coverage fraction ($f_c$ ) is defined as the ratio between the number of quasars exhibiting at least one detected absorber and the total number of quasars that can be used to detect absorptions with given criteria. We find that, for both \CIV \ and \MgII \ absorbers, both the number density of absorbers in given velocity intervals ($dn/d\beta$ ) and the $f_c$ show very significant excess at the low-velocity offset from the quasars, relative to the random occurrence that is expected for cosmologically intervening absorbers. These relative excess extensions for \MgII \ absorptions are not only evidently related to absorption strength but also to quasar luminosity, while they are mainly constrained within 2000 \kms \ no matter what quasar luminosity and absorption strength are. In addition, we find that the redshift number density ($dn/dz$ ) evolution of \MgII \ absorbers with \vabs \ $<2000$  \kms \ evidently differs from that with \vabs \ $>2000$  \kms. Turning to \CIV \ absorptions, the relative excess extensions of both $dn/d\beta$ and $f_c$ are mainly limited within \vabs $<4000$  \kms, and depend neither on absorption strength nor on quasar luminosity. And also, the absorbers with \vabs $<4000$  \kms \ show obviously different redshift number density evolution from those with \vabs $>4000$  \kms. We suggest velocity cuts of 4000 \kms \ and 2000 \kms \ to define quasar \CIV \ and \MgII \ associated NALs, respectively. "
1801_09579_foton_szilfiz.tex," Electron scattering and conduction on various types of impurities in semiconductor can be calculated via the first order Born approximation when the electrons are considered as free particles described by plane waves. In the following we present analytic angular differential cross section formula for electromagnetic radiation field assisted electron scattering on impurities approximated with various model potentials in semiconductors. The main idea describes the scattering electrons with the well-known Volkov wave function which automatically incorporates electron dynamics induced by the external oscillating filed. This description is well-known for strong laser fields from half a century.   The calculated electron conductance in the semiconductor could be enhanced with an order of magnitude if an infrared electromagnetic field is present with I = $10^{14}$ W/cm $^2$ intensity, which for instance will be achievable in the ELI-ALPS facility in the near future.

1801_05061_SolarSystem.tex," 	Given the fact that Earth is so far the only place in the Milky Way galaxy known to harbor life, the question arises of whether the solar system is in any way special. To address this question, I compare the solar system to the many recently discovered exoplanetary systems. I identify two main features that appear to distinguish the solar system from the majority of other systems: (i)~the lack of super-Earths, (ii)~the absence of close-in planets. I examine models for the formation of super-Earths, as well as models for the evolution of asteroid belts, the rate of asteroid impacts on Earth, and of snow lines, all of which may have some implications for the emergence and evolution of life on a terrestrial planet. 	 	Finally, I revisit an argument by Brandon Carter on the rarity of intelligent civilizations, and I review a few of the criticisms of this argument. "
1801_00335_shadows.tex,"  In the 1970s and again in the 1990s, Gromov gave a number of theorems and  conjectures motivated by the notion that the real homotopy theory of compact  manifolds and simplicial complexes influences the geometry of maps between  them. The main technical result of this paper supports this intuition: we show  that maps of differential algebras are closely shadowed, in a technical sense,  by maps between the corresponding spaces. As a concrete application, we prove  the following conjecture of Gromov: if $X$ and $Y$ are finite complexes with  $Y$ simply connected, then there are constants $C(X,Y)$ and $p(X,Y)$ such that  any two homotopic $L$ -Lipschitz maps have a $C(L+1)^p$ -Lipschitz homotopy (and  if one of the maps is constant, $p$ can be taken to be $2$ .) We hope that it  will lead more generally to a better understanding of the space of maps from  $X$ to $Y$ in this setting. "
1801_00473_sarkar.tex," We investigate the morphological and magnetic characteristics of solar active region (AR) NOAA 12192. AR 12192 was the largest region of Solar Cycle 24; it underwent noticeable growth and produced 6 X-class flares, 22 M-class flares, and 53 C-class flares in the course of its disc passage. However, the most peculiar fact of this AR is that it was associated with only one CME in spite of producing several X-class flares. In this work, we carry out a comparative study between the eruptive and non-eruptive flares produced by AR 12192. We find that the magnitude of abrupt and permanent changes in the horizontal magnetic field and Lorentz force are significantly smaller in the case of the confined flares compared to the eruptive one. We present the areal evolution of AR 12192 during its disc passage. We find the flare-related morphological changes to be weaker during the confined flares, whereas the eruptive flare exhibits a rapid and permanent disappearance of penumbral area away from the magnetic neutral line after the flare. Furthermore, from the extrapolated nonlinear force-free magnetic field, we examine the overlying coronal magnetic environment over the eruptive and non-eruptive zones of the AR. We find that the critical decay index for the onset of torus instability was achieved at a lower height over the eruptive flaring region, than for the non-eruptive core area. These results suggest that the decay rate of the gradient of overlying magnetic field strength may play a decisive role to determine the CME productivity of the AR. In addition, the magnitude of changes in the flare-related magnetic characteristics are found to be well correlated with the nature of solar eruptions.   "
1801_07039_OpticalFingerprintNonCovalentlyFunctionalizedTMDs.tex," Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) hold promising potential for applications in optoelectronics. Due to their direct band gap and the extraordinarily strong Coulomb interaction, TMDs exhibit efficient light-matter coupling and tightly bound excitons. Moreover, large spin orbit coupling in combination with circular dichroism allows for spin and valley selective optical excitation. As atomically thin materials, they are very sensitive to changes in the surrounding environment. This motivates a functionalization approach, where external molecules are adsorbed to the materials surface to tailor its optical properties. Here, we apply the density matrix theory to investigate the potential of non-covalently functionalized TMDs. Considering exemplary spiropyran molecules with a strong dipole moment, we predict spectral redshifts and the appearance of an additional side peak in the absorption spectrum of functionalized TMDs. We show that the molecular characteristics, e.g. coverage, orientation and dipole moment, crucially influence the optical properties of TMDs, leaving a unique optical fingerprint in the absorption spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the molecular dipole moments open a channel for coherent intervalley coupling between the high-symmetry K and K' points which may open new possibilities for spin-valleytronics application.  "
1801_07372_ms.tex," We study deep learning approaches to inferring numerical coordinates for points of interest in an input image. Existing convolutional neural network-based solutions to this problem either take a heatmap matching approach or regress to coordinates with a fully connected output layer. Neither of these approaches is ideal, since the former is not entirely differentiable, and the latter lacks inherent spatial generalization. We propose our differentiable spatial to numerical transform (DSNT) to fill this gap. The DSNT layer adds no trainable parameters, is fully differentiable, and exhibits good spatial generalization. Unlike heatmap matching, DSNT works well with low heatmap resolutions, so it can be dropped in as an output layer for a wide range of existing fully convolutional architectures. Consequently, DSNT offers a better trade-off between inference speed and prediction accuracy compared to existing techniques. When used to replace the popular heatmap matching approach used in almost all state-of-the-art methods for pose estimation, DSNT gives better prediction accuracy for all model architectures tested. "
1801_07594_On_the_whereabouts_6.tex," It was recently found that it is theoretically possible for there to exist higher-order quantum processes in which the order of the operations performed by separate parties cannot be ascribed a definite causal order. Such processes, called causally nonseparable, are expected to be relevant in the context of quantum gravity, but some of them have been claimed to have a physical realization in standard regimes via coherent control of the times of the operations. A prominent example is the quantum SWITCH, where the order of the operations of two parties is conditioned on the logical value of a control qubit that can be prepared in a superposition. This idea has been shown to offer novel information processing capabilities, and was recently demonstrated experimentally. However, up until now, there has been no rigorous justification for the interpretation of such an experiment as a genuine realization of a causally nonseparable process, which by definition should involve each of the local operations of the parties occurring once on a specific pair of input and output systems. Where exactly are the local operations in such an experiment? On what spaces do they act given that their times are indefinite? Can we probe them directly rather than assume what they ought to be based on heuristic considerations? How can we reconcile the claim that these operations really take place, each once as required, with the fact that the causal nonseparability of the presumed process implies that they cannot be part of any acyclic circuit? Here, I offer a precise answer to these questions: the input and output systems of the operations in such a process are generally nontrivial subsystems of Hilbert spaces that are tensor products of Hilbert spaces associated with different times---a claim that is both mathematically consistent and directly experimentally verifiable. With respect to these time-delocalized subsystems, the structure of the process is that of a circuit with a cycle, which cannot be decomposed into an acyclic circuit or a probabilistic mixture of acyclic circuits. I further show that all bipartite processes that obey a recently proposed unitary extension postulate, together with their unitary extensions, have a physical realization on such time-delocalized subsystems, and provide evidence that even more general processes might be physically admissible. These results unveil a novel structure within quantum mechanics, which may have important implications for physics and information processing.   "

For this purpose, we characterize the $\phi$ -Connes amenability of a dual Banach algebra $A$ through the existence of a specified net in $A\otimesA$ , where $\phi$ is a non-zero $wk^\ast$ -continuous character. Using this, we show that $UP(I,A)$ is Connes amenable if and only if $I$ is singleton and $A$ is Connes amenable. In addition, some examples of $\phi$ -Connes amenable dual Banach algebras, which is not Connes amenable are given. "

1801_00309_DD_dynamics_v6.tex," We study the 1D dynamics of dark-dark solitons in the miscible regime of two density-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates having repulsive interparticle interactions within each condensate ( $g>0$ ). By using an adiabatic perturbation theory in the parameter $g_{12}/{g}$ , we show that, contrary to the case of two solitons in scalar condensates, the interactions between solitons are attractive when the interparticle interactions between condensates are repulsive $g_{12}>0$ . As a result, the relative motion of dark solitons with equal chemical potential $\mu$ is well approximated by harmonic oscillations of angular frequency  $w_r=(({8/{15}){g_{12}}/{g}}$ . We also show that in finite systems, the resonance of this anomalous excitation mode with the spin density mode of lowest energy gives rise to alternating dynamical instability and stability fringes as a function of the perturbative parameter. In the presence of harmonic trapping (with angular frequency $\Omega$ ) the solitons are driven by the superposition of two harmonic motions at a frequency given by $w^2=(2)^2+w_r^2$ . When $g_{12}<0$ , these two oscillators compete to give rise to an overall effective potential that can be either single well or double well through a pitchfork bifurcation. All our theoretical results are compared with numerical solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the dynamics and the Bogoliubov equations for the linear stability. A good agreement is found between them. 		 	"
1801_06368_main.tex," Online game involves a very large number of users who are interconnected and interact with each other via the Internet.  We studied the characteristics of exchanging virtual goods with real money through processes called ``real money trading (RMT)''. This exchange might influence online game user behaviors and cause damage to the reputation of game companies.  We examined in-game transactions to reveal RMT by constructing a social graph of virtual goods exchanges in an online game and identifying network communities of users. We analyzed approximately 6,000,000 transactions in a popular online game and inferred RMT transactions by comparing the RMT transactions crawled from an out-game market. Our findings are summarized as follows: (1) the size of the RMT market could be approximately estimated; (2) professional RMT providers typically form a specific network structure (either star-shape or chain) in the trading network, which can be used as a clue for tracing RMT transactions; and (3) the observed RMT market has evolved over time into a monopolized market with a small number of large-sized virtual goods providers.

1801_07987_calic.tex," Recently a number of CNN-based techniques were proposed to remove image compression artifacts. As in other restoration applications, these techniques all learn a mapping from decompressed patches to the original counterparts under the ubiquitous $\ell_2$ metric. However, this approach is incapable of restoring distinctive image details which may be statistical outliers but have high semantic importance (e.g., tiny lesions in medical images). To overcome this weakness, we propose to incorporate an $\ell_\infty$ fidelity criterion in the design of neural network so that no small, distinctive structures of the original image can be dropped or distorted. Moreover, our anti-artifacts neural network is designed to work on a range of compression bit rates, rather than a fixed one as in the past. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ error metrics, and also perceptually. It can restore subtle image details that are otherwise destroyed or missed by other algorithms. Our research suggests a new machine learning paradigm of ultra high fidelity image compression that is ideally suited for applications in medicine, space, and sciences. "

1801_08660_main.tex," Out-of-vocabulary word translation is a major problem for the translation of low-resource languages that suffer from a lack of parallel training data. This paper evaluates the contributions of target-language context models towards the translation of OOV words, specifically in those cases where OOV translations are derived from external knowledge sources, such as dictionaries. We develop both neural and non-neural context models and evaluate them within both phrase-based and self-attention based neural machine translation systems. Our results show that neural language models that integrate additional context beyond the current sentence are the most effective in disambiguating possible OOV word translations. We present an efficient second-pass lattice-rescoring method for wide-context neural language models and demonstrate performance improvements over state-of-the-art self-attention based neural MT systems in five out of six low-resource language pairs.

This work places the tentative ideas proposed in [R.~Dickinson, J.~Forshaw and P.~Millington, J.\bf 631  (2015) 012059] on more solid and general mathematical foundations and incorporates the ``energy-parity"" symmetry introduced in [A.~D.~Linde, Phys.\bf 200 B (1988) 272; D.~E.~Kaplan and R.~Sundrum, JHEP {\bf 0607} (2006) 042] . The interplay of the positive- and negative-energy states allows for cancellations of the vacuum energy. Both the positive- and negative-energy states have positive norms, and their direct mixing is prevented by virtue of the zero divisors of the bicomplex numbers, thereby eliminating the possibility of negative-energy cascades. We suggest that the same interplay of positive- and negative-energy states may allow Haag's theorem to be circumvented, removing the associated criticism of the Fock representation. We consider scalar theories with cubic and quartic interactions and describe how this construction may yield transition probabilities consistent with the standard scattering theory. Whilst these results are intriguing, we draw attention to potentially serious limitations in relation to perturbative unitarity. "
1801_09228_GamDor_evol_RMO_4Arxiv.tex,"Helioseismology and asteroseismology of red giant stars have shown that distribution of angular momentum in stellar interiors, and its evolution with time remains an open issue in stellar physics. Owing to the unprecedented quality and long baseline of \Kepler photometry, we are able to seismically infer internal rotation rates in $\gamma$ Doradus stars, which provide the main-sequence counterpart to the red-giants puzzle."
1801_07013_CoveringSimilarity-v2.tex," This paper introduces the sequence covering similarity, that we formally define for evaluating the similarity between a symbolic sequence (string) and a set of symbolic sequences (strings). From this covering similarity we derive a pair-wise distance to compare two symbolic sequences.  We show that this covering distance is a semimetric. Few examples are given to show how this string semimetric in $O(n \cdot log n)$ compares with the Levenshtein's distance that is in $O(n^2)$ . A final example presents its application to plagiarism detection. %Finally we experiment this metric on three benchmarks on symbolic sequence classification, all three related to bioinformatics problems.

When the space is odd dimensional, we show that the map from the initial value to the trace of the solution on the light cone is an isometry and we characterize the range of this map and construct its inverse.

1801_02707_Short-XLDM_20180106.tex,"  \noindent In the context of a simplified Dark Matter (DM) scenario where the mediator is a new charged fermion carrying leptonic quantum number and the DM candidate is either scalar or vector, the complementarity of different bounds is analysed. In this framework, the extra lepton and  DM are odd under a \Z symmetry, hence the leptonic mediator can only interact with the DM state and Standard Model (SM) leptons of various flavours. We show that there is the possibility to characterise the DM spin (scalar or vector), as well as the nature of the mediator, through a combined analysis of cosmological, flavour  and collider data. We present an explicit numerical analysis for a set of benchmarks points of the viable parameter space of our scenario.  "
1801_05980_atom-atom-gate.tex," Quantum logic gates are fundamental building blocks of quantum computers. Their integration into quantum networks requires strong qubit coupling to network channels, as can be realized with neutral atoms and optical photons in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here we demonstrate that the long-range interaction mediated by a flying photon performs a gate between two stationary atoms inside an optical cavity from which the photon is reflected. This single step executes the gate in $2\micro s$ . We show an entangling operation between the two atoms by generating a Bell state with $76(2)\%$ fidelity. The gate also operates as a CNOT. We demonstrate $74.1(1.6)\%$ overlap between the observed and the ideal gate output, limited by the state preparation fidelity of $80.2(0.8)\%$ . As the atoms are efficiently connected to a photonic channel, our gate paves the way towards quantum networking with multiqubit nodes and the distribution of entanglement in repeater-based long-distance quantum networks.

1801_06652_Dissolution_stress_Roded_EPSL_rev_1_ARXIV_1.tex," 		We study reactive transport in a stressed porous media, where dissolution of the solid matrix causes two simultaneous, competing effects: pore enlargement due to chemical deformation, and pore compaction due to mechanical weakening. We use a novel, mechanistic pore-scale model to simulate flooding of a sample under fixed confining stress. Our simulations show that increasing the stress inhibits the permeability enhancement, increasing the injected volume required to reach a certain permeability, in agreement with recent experiments. We explain this behavior by stress concentration downstream, in the less dissolved (hence stiffer) outlet region. As this region is also less conductive, even its small compaction has a strong bottleneck effect that curbs the permeability. 		 Our results also elucidate that the impact of stress depends on the dissolution regime. Under wormholing conditions (slow injection, i.e. high Damkohler number, $Da$ ), the development of a sharp dissolution front and high porosity contrast accentuates the bottleneck effect. This reduces transport heterogeneity, promoting wormhole competition. Once the outlet starts eroding, the extreme focusing of transport and hence dissolution---characteristic of wormholing---becomes dominant, diminishing the bottleneck effect and hence the impact of stress at breakthrough. In contrast, at high flow rates (low $Da$ ), incomplete reaction upstream allows some of the reagent to traverse the sample, causing a more uniform dissolution. The continuous dissolution and its partial counteraction by compaction at the outlet provides a steady, gradual increase in the effect of stress. Consequently, the impact of stress is more pronounced at high $Da$ during early stages (low permeability), and at low $Da$ close to breakthrough. Our work promotes understanding of the interplay between dissolution and compaction and its effect on the hydromechanical property evolution, with important implications for processes ranging from diagenesis and weathering of rocks, to well stimulation and carbon geosequetration.

1801_07009_sample-sigconf.tex," Mobile apps have become ubiquitous. For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge.  Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist --- this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics ( \eg, manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available to share with and benefit the community. 	 "
1801_08184_RotationPaperArXiv.tex," The calibration of complex computer codes using uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods is a rich area of statistical methodological development. When applying these techniques to simulators with spatio-temporal output, it is now standard to use principal component decomposition to reduce the dimensions of the outputs in order to allow Gaussian process emulators to predict the output for calibration. We outline the `terminal case', in which the model cannot reproduce observations to within model discrepancy, and for which standard calibration methods in UQ fail to give sensible results. We show that even when there is no such issue with the model, the standard decomposition on the outputs can and usually does lead to a terminal case analysis. We present a simple test to allow a practitioner to establish whether their experiment will result in a terminal case analysis and a methodology for defining calibration-optimal bases that avoid this whenever it is not inevitable. We apply these ideas to the CanAM4 model to demonstrate the terminal case issue arising for climate models. We discuss climate model tuning and the estimation of model discrepancy within this context, and show how the optimal rotation algorithm can be used in developing practical climate model tuning tools.

1801_05532_sigconf.tex," A recommender system aims to recommend items that a user is interested in among many items. The need for the recommender system has been expanded by the information explosion. Various approaches have been suggested for providing meaningful recommendations to users. One of the proposed approaches is to consider a recommender system as a Markov decision process (MDP) problem and try to solve it using reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing RL-based methods have an obvious drawback. To solve an MDP in a recommender system, they encountered a problem with the large number of discrete actions that bring RL to a larger class of problems. In this paper, we propose a novel RL-based recommender system. We formulate a recommender system as a gridworld game by using a biclustering technique that can reduce the state and action space significantly. Using biclustering not only reduces space but also improves the recommendation quality effectively handling the cold-start problem. In addition, our approach can provide users with some explanation why the system recommends certain items. Lastly, we examine the proposed algorithm on a real-world dataset and achieve a better performance than the widely used recommendation algorithm. "
1801_08599_guo_ISBI2018_final.tex," This paper reports Deep LOGISMOS approach to 3D tumor segmentation by incorporating boundary information derived from deep contextual learning to LOGISMOS -- layered optimal graph image segmentation of multiple objects and surfaces. Accurate and reliable tumor segmentation is essential to tumor growth analysis and treatment selection. %In this paper, we propose a 3D tumor segmentation framework that incorporates deep learning into a layered optimal graph image segmentation of multiple objects and surfaces (called Deep LOGISMOS) . A fully convolutional network (FCN), UNet, is first trained using three adjacent 2D patches centered at the tumor, providing contextual UNet segmentation and probability map for each 2D patch. The UNet segmentation is then refined by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and morphological operations. The refined UNet segmentation is used to provide the initial shape boundary to build a segmentation graph. The cost for each node of the graph is determined by the UNet probability maps. Finally, a max-flow algorithm is employed to find the globally optimal solution thus obtaining the final segmentation. For evaluation, we applied the method to pancreatic tumor segmentation on a dataset of 51 CT scans, among which 30 scans were used for training and 21 for testing. With Deep LOGISMOS, DICE Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Relative Volume Difference (RVD) reached 83.2 $\pm$ 7.8 \% and 18.6$\pm$ 17.4 \% respectively, both are significantly improved (p$<$ 0.05) compared with contextual UNet and/or LOGISMOS alone.

1801_10232_chains_mc.tex,"        A recent observation of a threshold momentum difference in the  production of adjacent hadrons is implemented in the fragmentation model   of a three-dimensional QCD string, with the aim to investigate the  common origin of the azimuthal ordering of hadrons and of the  correlations commonly attributed to the Bose-Einstein effect.   The role of particle decays and their polarization in the  measurement of two-particle correlations is evaluated. A comparison with  the available data is presented and further measurements  suggested. The impact of the hadronization on the long range angular  correlations is discussed.    "
1801_00064_paper.tex," We investigate the competition between charge-density-wave (CDW) states and a Coulomb interaction-driven topological Mott insulator (TMI) in the honeycomb extended Hubbard model. For the spinful model with onsite ( $U$ ) and next-nearest-neighbor ( $V_2$ ) Coulomb interactions at half filling we find two peculiar six-sublattice charge-density-wave (CDW) insulating states by using variational Monte Carlo simulation as well as the Hartree-Fock approximation. We observe that conventional ordered states always win with respect to the TMI. The ground state is given in the large- $V_2$ region by a CDW characterized by a 220200 (001122) charge configuration for smaller (larger) $U$ , where 0, 1 and 2 denote essentially empty, singly- and doubly-occupied sites. Within the 001122-type CDW phase, we find a magnetic transition driven by an emergent coupled-dimer antiferromagnet on an effective square lattice of singly-occupied sites. Possible realizations of the states found are discussed. "
1801_07456_critical_path_heuristic.tex," In metabolomics, small molecules are structurally elucidated using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS); this resulted in the computational Maximum Colorful Subtree problem, which is NP-hard. Unfortunately, data from a single metabolite requires us to solve hundreds or thousands of instances of this problem; and in a single Liquid Chromatography MS/MS run, hundreds or thousands of metabolites are measured. Here, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of several heuristic algorithms for the problem against an exact algorithm. We put particular emphasis on whether a heuristic is able to rank candidates such that the correct solution is ranked highly. We propose this ``intermediate'' evaluation because evaluating the approximating quality of heuristics is misleading: Even a slightly suboptimal solution can be structurally very different from the true solution. On the other hand, we cannot structurally evaluate against the ground truth, as this is unknown. We find that one particular heuristic consistently ranks the correct solution in a top position, allowing us to speed up computations about 100-fold. We also find that scores of the best heuristic solutions are very close to the optimal score; in contrast, the structure of the solutions can deviate significantly from the optimal structures. "
1801_07309_numeraire.tex," In a stock market, the {\em numeraire portfolio,} if it exists, is the portfolio with the highest expected logarithmic growth rate at all times. A {\em numeraire market} is a stock market for which the market portfolio is the numeraire portfolio. We study {\em open markets,} markets comprising the higher capitalization stocks within a broad equity universe. The stocks we consider are represented by continuous semimartingales, and we construct an example of a numeraire market that is asymptotically stable. "
1801_08712_main.tex," In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have emerged as a powerful method for learning the mapping from noisy latent spaces to realistic data samples in high-dimensional space. So far, the development and application of GANs have been predominantly focused on spatial data such as images. In this project, we aim at modeling of spatio-temporal sensor data instead, i.e. \ dynamic data over time. The main goal is to encode temporal data into a global and low-dimensional latent vector that captures the dynamics of the spatio-temporal signal. To this end, we incorporate auto-regressive RNNs, Wasserstein GAN loss, spectral norm weight constraints and a semi-supervised learning scheme into InfoGAN, a method for retrieval of meaningful latents in adversarial learning. To demonstrate the modeling capability of our method, we encode full-body skeletal human motion from a large dataset representing 60 classes of daily activities, recorded in a multi-Kinect setup. Initial results indicate competitive classification performance of the learned latent representations, compared to direct CNN/RNN inference. In future work, we plan to apply this method on a related problem in the medical domain, i.e. \ on recovery of meaningful latents in gait analysis of patients with vertigo and balance disorders. "

This component is interpreted as a consequence of Gamov state formation, with the hyperon trapped in the Coulomb field of the residual nucleus.  Description of such states and their participation in the capture reaction is presented. Some consequences are indicated. "
1801_05513_KG-MuonAttenuationLength.tex,"      \footnotesize       The evolution of the muon content of very high energy air showers (EAS) in the  atmosphere is investigated with data of the KASCADE-Grande observatory. For this  purpose, the muon attenuation length in the atmosphere is obtained to  $+229_{-232}(syst)\,  g/cm^2$ from the experimental data for shower energies between $10^{16.3}$   and  $10^{17.0} eV$ . Comparison of this quantity with predictions of the  high-energy hadronic interaction models QGSJET-II-02, SIBYLL 2.1, QGSJET-II-04 and  EPOS-LHC reveals that the attenuation of the muon content of measured EAS  in the atmosphere is lower than predicted. Deviations are, however, less  significant with the post-LHC models. The presence of such deviations seems to  be related to a difference between the simulated and the measured zenith angle  evolutions of the lateral muon density distributions of EAS, which also causes  a discrepancy between the measured absorption lengths of the density of shower  muons and the predicted ones at large distances from the EAS core. The studied  deficiencies show that all four considered hadronic interaction models fail to  describe consistently the zenith angle evolution of the muon content of EAS in  the aforesaid energy regime.

1801_01855_Estrada_et_al_2018j.tex," We study the superconducting proximity effect in an InAs nanowire contacted by Ta-based superconducting electrodes. Using local bottom gates, we control the potential landscape along the nanowire, tuning its conductance to a quasi-ballistic regime. At high magnetic field ( $B$ ), we observe approximately quantized conductance plateaus associated with the first two spin-polarized one-dimensional modes. For $B < 1$ T, the onset of superconductivity occurs in concomitance with the development of sizeable charge localization leading to a 0.7-type conductance anomaly. In this regime, the proximity supercurrent exhibits an unusual, non-monotonic $B$ dependence. We interpret this finding in terms of a competition between the Kondo effect, dominating near $B=0$ , and the Zeeman effect, enforcing spin polarization and the emergence of a $\pi$ phase shift in the Josephson relation at higher $B$ .

1801_06376_pqs.tex," We propose a definition of partition quantum spaces. They are given by universal \(C^* \)-algebras whose relations come from partitions of sets. We ask for the maximal compact matrix quantum group acting on them. We show how those fit into the setting of easy quantum groups: Our approach yields spaces these groups are acting on. In a way, our partition quantum spaces arise as the first \(d \) columns of easy quantum groups. However, we define them as universal \(C^* \)-algebras rather than as \(C^* \)-subalgebras of easy quantum groups. We also investigate the minimal number \(d \) needed to recover an easy quantum group as the quantum symmetry group of a partition quantum space. In the free unitary case, \(d \) takes the values one or two. "
1801_01396_Metro6.tex," Given a quantum state with an unknown parameter, the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a measure of the amount of information that an observable can extract about the parameter. QFI also quantifies the maximum achievable precision in estimating the parameter with a given amount of resource via an inequality known as quantum Cramer-Rao bound. In this work, we describe a protocol to amplify QFI of a single target qubit precorrelated with a set of ancillary qubits. A single quadrature measurement of only ancillary qubits suffices to perform the complete quantum state tomography (QST) of the target qubit. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol using an NMR system consisting of a $^{13}$ C nuclear spin as the target qubit and three $^1$ H nuclear spins as ancillary qubits. We prepare the target qubit in various initial states, perform QST, and estimate the amplification of QFI in each case. We also show that the QFI-amplification scales linearly with the number of ancillary qubits and quadratically with their purity. "
1801_06727_Article.v8.tex," This article develops a statistical test for the null hypothesis of strict stationarity of a discrete time stochastic process. When the null hypothesis is true, the second order cumulant spectrum is zero at all the discrete Fourier frequency pairs present in the principal domain of the cumulant spectrum. The test uses a frame (window) averaged sample estimate of the second order cumulant spectrum to build a test statistic that has an asymptotic complex standard normal distribution. We derive the test statistic, study the size and power properties of the test, and demonstrate its implementation with intraday stock market return data. The test has conservative size properties and good power to detect varying variance and unit root in the presence of varying variance. "
1801_09325.tex," We propose $S_4$ symmetric four-generation models for quarks and charged leptons. Although an $S_4$ symmetric four-generation model has been already proposed, there are some redundant assumptions and additional parameters in the model.

1801_00428_ms.tex," 	In Sanskrit, small words (morphemes) are combined through a morphophonological process called Sandhi to form compound words. Sandhi splitting is the process of splitting a given compound word into its constituent morphemes. Although rules governing the splitting of words exist, it is highly challenging to identify the location of the splits in a compound word, as the same compound word might be broken down in multiple ways to provide syntactically correct splits. % it is highly challenging to identify where the split(s) occur, as the same compound word might be broken down in multiple ways to provide partly correct splits. Existing systems explore incorporating these pre-defined splitting rules, but have low accuracy since they don't address the fundamental problem of identifying the split location. 	 	With this work, we propose a novel Double Decoder RNN (DD-RNN) architecture which i) predicts the location of the split(s) with an accuracy of 95 \% and ii) predicts the constituent words (i.e. learning the Sandhi splitting rules) with an accuracy of 79.5 \%. To the best of our knowledge, deep learning techniques have never been applied to the Sandhi splitting problem before. We further demonstrate that our model out-performs the previous state-of-the-art significantly. 	 	% In this research, we formulate a Sandhi split location prediction algorithm for compound Sanskrit words using a deep bi-directional character RNN with Attention(AB-RNN). The proposed AB-RNN takes a compound word as input in the form of a character sequence and predicts the probability of split at character index. The advantage of the proposed AB-RNN is its ability to remember long term dependencies in a given sequence, thus providing good performance. We further release a large scale corpus for evaluating sandhi splitting techniques and benchmark our technique on it. "
1801_08657_2D_turbulence.tex," We present two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the fully kinetic collisionless magnetorotational instability (MRI) in weakly magnetized (high $\beta$ ) pair plasma. The central result of this numerical analysis is the emergence of a self-induced turbulent regime in the saturation state of the collisionless MRI, which can only be captured for large enough simulation domains. One of the underlying mechanisms for the development of this turbulent state is the drift-kink instability (DKI) of the current sheets resulting from the nonlinear evolution of the channel modes. The onset of the DKI can only be observed for simulation domain sizes exceeding several linear MRI wavelengths. The DKI, together with ensuing magnetic reconnection, activate the turbulent motion of the plasma in the late stage of the nonlinear evolution of the MRI. At steady state, the magnetic energy has an MHD-like spectrum with a slope of $k^{-5/3}$ for $k\rho<1$ and $k^{-3}$ for sub-Larmor scale ( $k\rho>1$ ). We also examine the role of the collisionless MRI and associated magnetic reconnection in the development of pressure anisotropy. We study the stability of the system due to this pressure anisotropy, observing the development of mirror instability during the early-stage of the MRI. We further discuss the importance of magnetic reconnection for particle acceleration during the turbulence regime. In particular, consistent with reconnection studies, we show that at late times the kinetic energy presents a characteristic slope of $-2$ in the high-energy region. "
1801_08875_bajkbob.tex," {This paper is devoted to the refinement of the parameters of the six three-component (bulge, disk, halo) axisymmetric Galactic gravitational potential models on the basis of modern data on circular velocities of Galactic objects located at distances up to 200 kpc from the Galactic center.

To describe the halo, the models of Allen-Santill\'an (I), Wilkinson-Evans (II), Navarro-Frenk-White (III), Binney (IV), Plummer (V), and Hernquist (VI) are used. The sought-for parameters of potential models are determined by fitting the model rotation curves to the measured velocities, taking into account restrictions on the local dynamical matter density $-3$ and the vertical force $|K_{z=1.1}|/2-2$. A comparative analysis of the refined potential models is made and for each of the models the estimates of a number of the Galactic characteristics are presented.}  "
1801_07927_Manuscript_V5.tex," We present a comprehensible introduction to tight informationally complete measurements for arbitrarily large multipartite systems and study their allowed entanglement configurations, focusing on those requiring simplest possible quantum resources. We demonstrate that tight measurements cannot be exclusively composed neither by fully separable nor maximally entangled states, according to a selected measure of entanglement. We establish an upper bound on the maximal number of fully separable states allowed by tight measurements and we study the distinguished case in which every measurement operator has the same amount of entanglement. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of nested tight measurements, i.e. multipartite tight informationally complete measurements such that every reduction to a certain number of parties induces a lower dimensional tight measurement, proving that they exist for any number of parties and internal levels.  %Tight informationally complete positive operator valued measures (TIC-POVM) are remarkable geometrical structures in quantum mechanics. They allow us to solve the quantum tomography problem in a simple way in every dimension where they exist. For example, maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases and symmetric IC-POVM are tight sets. %The study of entanglement for some special Tight IC-POVM have been recently done. In this work, we study entanglement restrictions for multipartite Tight IC-POVM. In particular, we demonstrate that, contrary to the case of mutually unbiased bases, a SIC-POVM cannot be composed by fully separable or maximally entangled vectors in any dimension. "
1801_06635_bare_conf.tex," Displaying the large number of bands in a hyperspectral image (HSI) on a trichromatic monitor has been an active research topic. The visualized image shall convey as much information as possible from the original data and facilitate image interpretation. Most existing methods display HSIs in false colors, which contradict with human's experience and expectation. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear approach to visualize an input HSI with natural colors by taking advantage of a corresponding RGB image. Our approach is based on Moving Least Squares (MLS), an interpolation scheme for reconstructing a surface from a set of control points, which in our case is a set of matching pixels between the HSI and the corresponding RGB image. Based on MLS, the proposed method solves for each spectral signature a unique transformation so that the nonlinear structure of the HSI can be preserved. The matching pixels between a pair of HSI and RGB image can be reused to display other HSIs captured by the same imaging sensor with natural colors. %Besides, our approach also works well when the corresponding RGB image is captured on a semantically similar site to the HSI. Experiments show that the output images of the proposed method not only have natural colors but also maintain the visual information necessary for human analysis. "
1801_03278_main.tex," {It is generally believed that in the epoch prior to the formation of the first stars, the Universe was completely dark (the period is therefore known as the Dark Ages). Usually the start of this epoch is placed at the photon decoupling. In this work we investigate the question whether there was enough light during the dark epoch for a human eye to see. We use the black body spectrum of the Universe to find the flux of photon energy for different temperatures and compare them with visual limits of blindness and darkness. We find that the Dark Ages actually began approximately 5 million years later than commonly stated.} "
1801_00102_acl2018.tex," This paper presents a new deep learning architecture for Natural Language Inference (NLI). Firstly, we introduce a new compare-propagate architecture where alignments pairs are compared and then propagated to upper layers for enhanced representation learning. Secondly, we adopt novel factorization layers for efficient compression of alignment vectors into scalar valued features, which are then be used to augment the base word representations. The design of our approach is aimed to be conceptually simple, compact and yet powerful. We conduct experiments on three popular benchmarks, SNLI, MultiNLI and SciTail, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all. A lightweight parameterization of our model also enjoys a $\approx 300\%$ reduction in parameter size compared to the ESIM and DIIN, while maintaining competitive performance. Visual analysis shows that our propagated features are highly interpretable, opening new avenues to explainability in neural NLI models. "

1801_03504_DBbarB.tex," We study three-body systems composed of $D^{(*)}$ , $B^{(*)}$ and  $(*)$ in order to look for possible bound states or resonances. In order to solve the three-body problem, we use the fixed center approach for the Faddeev equations considering  that the $B^*\bB^*(B\bB)$  are clusterized systems, generated dynamically,  which interact with a third particle $D(D^*)$ whose mass is much smaller than the two-body bound states forming the cluster. In the $DB^*\bB^*$ , $D^*B^*\bB^*$ , $DB\bB$ and $D^*B\bB$ systems with  $I=1/2$ , we found clear bound state peaks with binding energies typically a few tens MeV and more uncertain broad resonant states about ten MeV above the threshold with widths of a few tens MeV.

1801_00462_ridesharing_v3.tex," We develop a numerical model using both artificial and empirical inputs to analyze taxi dynamics in an urban setting. More specifically, we quantify how the supply and demand for taxi services, the underlying road network, and the public acceptance of taxi ridesharing (TRS) affect the optimal number of taxis for a particular city, as well as commuters' average waiting time and trip time. Results reveal certain universal features of the taxi dynamics with real-time taxi-booking---that there is a well-defined transition between the oversaturated phase when demand exceeds supply, and the undersaturated phase when supply exceeds demand. The boundary between the two phases gives the optimal number of taxis a city should accommodate, given the specific demand, road network and commuter habits. Adding or removing taxis may affect commuter experience very differently in the two phases revealed. In the oversaturated phase the average waiting time is affected exponentially, while in the undersaturated phase it is affected sub-linearly. We analyze various factors that can shift the phase boundary, and show that an increased level of acceptance for TRS universally shifts the phase boundary by reducing the number of taxis needed. We discuss some of the useful insights on the benefits and costs of TRS, especially how under certain situations TRS will not only have economic benefits for commuters, but can also save the overall travel time for the shared parties, by significantly reducing the time commuters spend on waiting for taxis. Our simulations also suggest that simple artificial taxi systems can capture most of the universal features of the taxi dynamics. The relevance of the assumptions and the overall methodology are also illustrated using the empirical road network and taxi demand in Singapore. "

We consider a probability distribution that generates network structures, and optimize the parameters of the distribution instead of directly optimizing the network structure. The proposed method can apply to the various network structure optimization problems under the same framework. We apply the proposed method to several structure optimization problems such as selection of layers, selection of unit types, and selection of connections using the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method can find the appropriate and competitive network structures. "
1801_07604_camera_ready.tex,"  Blockchains enables tamper-proof, ordered logging for transactional data in a decentralized manner over open-access, overlay peer-to-peer networks. In this paper, we propose a decentralized framework of proactive caching in a hierarchical wireless network based on blockchains. We employ the blockchain-based smart contracts to construct an autonomous content caching market. In the market, the cache helpers are able to autonomously adapt their caching strategies according to the market statistics obtained from the blockchain, and the truthfulness of trustless nodes are financially enforced by smart contract terms. Further, we propose an incentive-compatible consensus mechanism based on proof-of-stake to financially encourage the cache helpers to stay active in service. We model the interaction between the cache helpers and the content providers as a Chinese restaurant game. Based on the theoretical analysis regarding the Nash equilibrium of the game, we propose a decentralized strategy-searching algorithm using sequential best response. The simulation results demonstrate both the efficiency and reliability of the proposed equilibrium searching algorithm. "
1801_10134_7umPaper.tex," An atom exposed to an electric field will experience Stark shifts of its internal energy levels, proportional to their polarizabilities. In optical frequency metrology, the Stark shift due to background black-body radiation (BBR) modifies the frequency of the optical clock transition, and often represents a large contribution to a clock's uncertainty budget. For clocks based on singly-ionized ytterbium, the ion's complex structure makes this shift difficult to calculate theoretically. We present a measurement of the differential polarizabilities of two ultra-narrow optical clock transitions present in  , performed by exposing the ion to an oscillating electric field at a wavelength in the region of room temperature BBR spectra. By measuring the frequency shift to the transitions caused by a laser at $7.17{\micro\meter}$ , we obtain values for scalar and tensor differential polarizabilities with uncertainties at the percent level for both the electric quadrupole and octupole transitions at 436{\nano\meter} and 467{\nano\meter} respectively. These values agree with previously reported experimental measurements and, in the case of the electric quadrupole transition, allow a 5-fold improvement in the determination of the room-temperature BBR shift.

1801_02079_Helium_AIS_PRA.tex," The excitation of an autoionizing resonance by intense radiation requires a theoretical description beyond the transition probability per unit time. This implies a time-dependent formulation incorporating all features of the radiation source, such as pulse temporal shape and duration, as well as stochastic properties, for pulses other than Fourier limited. The radiation from short wavelength free electron lasers is a case in point, as it is the only source that can provide the necessary intensity. In view of ongoing experiments with such sources, we present a systematic study for an isolated autoionizing resonance. We find that intensity, pulse duration and field fluctuations conspire in producing unexpected excitation profiles, not amenable to a description in terms of the usual Fano profile. In particular, the role of intensity fluctuations turns out to pose challenging theoretical problems part of which have been addressed herein.      \item[PACS numbers] 32.80.Aa, 32.80.Hd, 32.70.Jz, 32.80.Rm  "
1801_10558_15_Feb.tex," A central task in quantum information processing is to characterize quantum processes. In the realm of optical quantum information processing, this amounts to characterizing the transformations of the mode creation and annihilation operators. This transformation is unitary for linear optical systems, whereas these yield the well-known Bogoliubov transformations for systems with Hamiltonians that are quadratic in the mode operators. In this paper, we show that a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer can characterize both these kinds of evolutions for multimode systems. While it suffices to use coherent states for the characterization of linear optical systems, we additionally require single photons to characterize quadratically nonlinear optical systems. "
1801_01632_Guo.tex," Jointing visual-semantic embeddings (VSE) have become a research hotpot for the task of image annotation, which suffers from the issue of semantic gap , i.e., the gap between images' visual features (low-level) and labels' semantic features (high-level). This issue will be even more challenging if visual features cannot be retrieved from images, that is, when images are only denoted by numerical IDs as given in some real datasets. The typical way of existing VSE methods is to perform a uniform sampling method for negative examples that violate the ranking order against positive examples, which requires a time-consuming search in the whole label space. In this paper, we propose a fast adaptive negative sampler that can work well in the settings of no figure pixels available. Our sampling strategy is to choose the negative examples that are most likely to meet the requirements of violation according to the latent factors of images. In this way, our approach can linearly scale up to large datasets. The experiments demonstrate that our approach converges 5.02x faster than the state-of-the-art approaches on OpenImages, 2.5x on IAPR-TCI2 and 2.06x on NUS-WIDE datasets, as well as better ranking accuracy across datasets.

1801_00754_isit18.tex,"  Device-to-Device (D2D) communication can support the operation of cellular systems by reducing the traffic in the network infrastructure. In this paper, the benefits of D2D communication are investigated in the context of a Fog-Radio Access Network (F-RAN) that leverages edge caching and fronthaul connectivity for the purpose of content delivery. Assuming offline caching, out-of-band D2D communication, and an F-RAN with two edge nodes and two user equipments, an information-theoretically optimal caching and delivery strategy is presented that minimizes the delivery time in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. The delivery time accounts for the latency caused by fronthaul, downlink, and D2D transmissions. The proposed optimal strategy is based on a novel scheme for an X-channel with receiver cooperation. Insights are provided on the regimes in which D2D communication is beneficial. "

We prove that the XL algorithm terminates at a certain value of  $D$ when the number of equations exceeds the number of variables by 1 or 2, and give strong evidence that this value is best possible.

The new implementation, already available in the Quantum ESPRESSO  distribution, results in a speedup that is never smaller than 3-4 $\times$ and  that increases with the size of the system, according to various realistic  benchmark calculations.

1801_08197_pg17_submit_1_arxiv.tex," Massive young stellar objects in the Magellanic Clouds show infrared absorption features corresponding to significant abundances of CO, CO $_2$ and H $_2$ O ice along the line of sight, with the relative abundances of these ices differing between the Magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way. CO ice is not detected towards sources in the Small Magellanic Cloud, and upper limits put its relative abundance well below sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way. We use our gas-grain chemical code MAGICKAL, with multiple grain sizes and grain temperatures, and further expand it with a treatment for increased interstellar radiation field intensity to model the elevated dust temperatures observed in the MCs. We also adjust the elemental abundances used in the chemical models, guided by observations of HII regions in these metal-poor satellite galaxies. With a grid of models, we are able to reproduce the relative ice fractions observed in MC massive young stellar objects (MYSOs), indicating that metal depletion and elevated grain temperature are important drivers of the MYSO envelope ice composition. Magellanic Cloud elemental abundances have a sub-galactic C/O ratio, increasing H $_2$ O ice abundances relative to the other ices; elevated grain temperatures favor CO $_2$ production over H $_2$ O and CO. The observed shortfall in CO in the Small Magellanic Cloud can be explained by a combination of reduced carbon abundance and increased grain temperatures. The models indicate that a large variation in radiation field strength is required to match the range of observed LMC abundances. CH $_3$ OH abundance is found to be enhanced in low-metallicity models, providing seed material for complex organic molecule formation in the Magellanic Clouds. "

The intermediate phase, occurring in a narrow temperature range (a few K), is documented for R = Gd-Ho as a collinear modulated structure, incommensurate with the lattice spacings. We report here on a $^{57}$ Fe M \""ossbauer study of 2 57$ Fe doped o-YbMnO $_3$ , where the spin only Fe $^{3+}$ ion plays the role of a magnetic probe.

We use a special quasi-uniform mesh in order to improve the numerical accuracy of the classical discrete fractional formula for the Caputo derivative. The stability and the convergence of the method are discussed. The error estimates established for a quasi-uniform grid and a uniform one are reported to support the theoretical results. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

1801_01196_main.tex," %maximum words: 150 Single electron spins coupled to multiple nuclear spins provide promising multi-qubit registers for quantum sensing and quantum networks. The obtainable level of control is determined by how well the electron spin can be selectively coupled to, and decoupled from, the surrounding nuclear spins. Here we realize a coherence time exceeding a second for a single electron spin through decoupling sequences tailored to its microscopic nuclear-spin environment. We first use the electron spin to probe the environment, which is accurately described by seven individual and six pairs of coupled carbon-13 spins. We develop initialization, control and readout of the carbon-13 pairs in order to directly reveal their atomic structure. We then exploit this knowledge to store quantum states for over a second by carefully avoiding unwanted interactions. These results provide a proof-of-principle for quantum sensing of complex multi-spin systems and an opportunity for multi-qubit quantum registers with long coherence times. "
1801_09125_abstract.tex," We propose a unified method for empirical non-parametric estimation of general Mutual Information (MI) function between the random vectors in $R^d$ based on $N$ i.i.d. samples. The proposed low complexity estimator is based on a bipartite graph, referred to as dependence graph. The data points are mapped to the vertices of this graph using randomized Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). The vertex and edge weights are defined in terms of marginal and joint hash collisions. For a given set of hash parameters $\epsilon(1), \ldots, \epsilon(k)$ , a base estimator is defined as a weighted average of the transformed edge weights. The proposed estimator, called the ensemble dependency graph estimator (EDGE), is obtained as a weighted average of the base estimators, where the weights are computed offline as the solution of a linear programming problem. EDGE achieves optimal computational complexity $O(N)$ , and can achieve the optimal parametric MSE rate of $O(1/N)$ if the density is $d$ times differentiable. To the best of our knowledge EDGE is the first non-parametric MI estimator that can achieve parametric MSE rates with linear time complexity. "

1801_04881_gxy_23.tex," Critical properties of the two-dimensional $XY$ model involving solely nematic-like biquadratic and bicubic terms are investigated by spin-wave analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. It is found that, even though neither of the nematic-like terms alone can induce magnetic ordering, their coexistence and competition leads to an extended phase of magnetic quasi-long-range order phase, wedged between the two nematic-like phases induced by the respective couplings. Thus, except for the muticritical point, at which all the phases meet, for any finite value of the coupling parameters ratio there are two phase transition: one from the paramagnetic phase to one of the two nematic-like phases followed by another one at lower temperatures to the magnetic phase. The finite-size scaling analysis indicate that the phase transitions between the magnetic and nematic-like phases belong to the Ising and three-state Potts universality classes. Inside the competition-induced algebraic magnetic phase the spin-pair correlation function is found to decay even much more slowly than in the standard $XY$ model with purely magnetic interactions. Such a magnetic phase is characterized by an extremely low vortex-antivortex pair density attaining a minimum close to the point at which the biquadratic and bicubic couplings are of about equal strengths and thus competition is the fiercest.

Here, we apply a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to study the structural symmetry and electronic topology of ZrSiSe. The glide mirror symmetry is verified by quantifying the lattice structure of the ZrSe bilayer based on bias selective topographies. The quasiparticle interference analysis is used to identify the band structure of ZrSiSe. The nodal line is experimentally determined at $\sim$ 250 meV above the Fermi level. An extra surface state Dirac point at $\sim$ 400 meV below the Fermi level is also determined. Our STM measurement provides a direct experimental evidence of the nodal-line state in the family of ZrSiX. "
1801_07473_DBEM_v2.tex," The drag-based model (DBM) for heliospheric propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is a widely used analytical model which can predict CME arrival time and speed at a given heliospheric location. It is based on the assumption that the propagation of CMEs in interplanetary space is solely under the influence of magnetohydrodynamical drag, where CME propagation is determined based on CME initial properties as well as the properties of the ambient solar wind. We present an upgraded version, covering ensemble modelling to produce a distribution of possible ICME arrival times and speeds, the drag-based ensemble model (DBEM). Multiple runs using uncertainty ranges for the input values can be performed in almost real-time, within a few minutes. This allows us to define the most likely ICME arrival times and speeds, quantify prediction uncertainties and determine forecast confidence. The performance of the DBEM is evaluated and compared to that of ensemble WSA-ENLIL+Cone model (ENLIL) using the same sample of events. It is found that the mean error is $ME=-9.7$ hours, mean absolute error $MAE=14.3$ hours and root mean square error $RMSE=16.7$ hours, which is somewhat higher than, but comparable to ENLIL errors ( $ME=-6.1$ hours, $MAE=12.8$ hours and $RMSE=14.4$ hours). Overall, DBEM and ENLIL show a similar performance. Furthermore, we find that in both models fast CMEs are predicted to arrive earlier than observed, most probably owing to the physical limitations of models, but possibly also related to an overestimation of the CME initial speed for fast CMEs.

1801_05787_paper.tex,"   Predicting human fixations from images has recently seen large improvements by leveraging deep   representations which were pretrained for object recognition. However, as we show in this paper,   these networks are highly overparameterized for the task of fixation prediction. We first   present a simple yet principled greedy pruning method which we call Fisher pruning. Through a   combination of knowledge distillation and Fisher pruning, we obtain much more runtime-efficient   architectures for saliency prediction, achieving a 10x speedup for the same AUC performance as a   state of the art network on the CAT2000 dataset. Speeding up single-image gaze prediction is   important for many real-world applications, but it is also a crucial step in the development of   video saliency models, where the amount of data to be processed is substantially larger.

To increase the channel capacity, we consider exploiting the polarisation information and send two different signals simultaneously at the same direction, same frequency, but with different polarisations. These two signals can also be considered as one composite signal using the four dimensional (4-D) modulation scheme across the two polarisation diversity channels. In this paper, based on cross-dipole arrays, we formulate the design to find a set of common weight coefficients to achieve directional modulation for such a composite signal and examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

1801_09628_main.tex," The Internet of Things and specifically the Tactile Internet give rise to significant challenges for notions of security. In this work, we introduce a novel concept for secure massive access. The core of our approach is a fast and low-complexity blind deconvolution algorithm exploring a bi-linear and hierarchical compressed sensing framework. We show that blind deconvolution has two appealing features: 1) There is no need to coordinate the pilot signals, so even in the case of collisions in user activity, the information messages can be resolved. 2) Since all the individual channels are recovered in parallel, and by assumed channel reciprocity, the measured channel entropy serves as a common secret and is used as an encryption key for each user. We will outline the basic concepts underlying the approach and describe the blind deconvolution algorithm in detail. Eventually, simulations demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to recover both channel and message. They also exhibit the inherent trade-offs of the scheme between economical recovery and secret capacity.%. If a channel is more sparse the recovery is improved but at the same time less entropy for key generation degrade the secrecy properties. "
1801_05948_UAV_conference_v8.tex," Using a drone as an aerial base station (ABS) to provide coverage to users on the ground is envisaged as a promising solution for beyond fifth generation (beyond-5G) wireless networks. While the literature to date has examined downlink cellular networks with ABSs, we consider an uplink cellular network with an ABS. Specifically, we analyze the use of an underlay ABS to provide coverage for a temporary event, such as a sporting event or a concert in a stadium. Using stochastic geometry, we derive the analytical expressions for the uplink coverage probability of the terrestrial base station (TBS) and the ABS. The results are expressed in terms of (i) the Laplace transforms of the interference power distribution at the TBS and the ABS and (ii) the distance distribution between the ABS and an independently and uniformly distributed (i.u.d.) ABS-supported user equipment and between the ABS and an i.u.d. TBS-supported user equipment. The accuracy of the analytical results is verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that varying the ABS height leads to a trade-off between the uplink coverage probability of the TBS and the ABS. In addition, assuming a quality of service of 90 \% at the TBS, an uplink coverage probability of the ABS of over 85 \% can be achieved, with the ABS deployed at or below its optimal height of typically between $250-500$ m for the considered setup.

1801_06450_Cell_free_WPT.tex," This paper studies a new concept so-called green cell-less radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) networks. We consider a scenario in which multiple indoor access points (APs) equipped with outdoor energy harvesters are connected with a central control unit via backhaul links. Further, such APs exploit the harnessed green energy to recharge wirelessly indoor devices under the coordination of the control unit. Considering the network, we focus on AP selection and beamforming optimization to maximize the total energy harvesting (EH) rate. The resulting mathematical problem has the form of mixed-integer optimization that is intractable to solve. Thus, we propose an algorithm to tackle this difficulty. Through numerical results, we show the advantages of the cell-less design over the conventional small-cell one to validate our ideas. In particular, the issue on safety requirements of human exposure to RF radiation is discussed. Finally, potential future research is provided. "

1801_01576_article_arxiv_v2.tex," An interplay of magnetic fields and gravitation drives accretion and outflows near black holes. However, a specific mechanism is still a matter of debate; it is very likely that different processes dominate under various conditions. In particular, for the acceleration of particles and their collimation in jets, an ordered component of the magnetic field seems to be essential. Here we discuss the role of large-scale magnetic fields in transporting the charged particles and dust grains from the bound orbits in the equatorial plane of a rotating (Kerr) black hole and the resulting acceleration along trajectories escaping the system in a direction parallel to the symmetry axis (perpendicular to the accretion disk). We consider a specific scenario of destabilization of circular geodesics of initially neutral matter by charging (e.g., due to photoionization). Some particles may be set on escaping trajectories and attain relativistic velocity. The case of charged particles differs from charged dust grains by their charge-to-mass ratio, but the acceleration mechanism operates in a similar manner. It appears that the chaotic dynamics controls the outflow and supports the formation of near-horizon escape zones. We employ the technique of recurrence plots to characterize the onset of chaos in the outflowing medium. We investigate the system numerically and construct the basin-boundary plots, which show the location and the extent of the escape zones. The effects of black hole spin and magnetic field strength on the formation and location of escape zones are discussed, and the maximal escape velocity is computed. "

1801_07370_manuscript.tex," Oxygen is the most abundant ``metal'' element in stars and in the cosmos. But determining oxygen abundances in stars has proven challenging, because of the shortage of detectable atomic oxygen lines in their optical spectra as well as observational and theoretical complications with these lines (e.g., blends, 3D, non-LTE). Nonetheless, tin17b were recently able to demonstrate that oxygen abundances can be determined from low-resolution ( $R \simeq 2000$ ) optical spectra. Here we investigate the physical processes that enable such a measurement for cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that the strongest spectral diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO atomic-molecular network, but are manifested in spectral features that do not involve oxygen. In the outer atmosphere layers most of the carbon is locked up in CO, and changes to the oxygen abundance directly affect the abundances of all other carbon-bearing molecules, thereby changing the strength of CH, CN, and C $_2$ features across the optical spectrum. In deeper atmosphere layers most of the carbon is in atomic form, and any change in the oxygen abundance has little effect on the other carbon-bearing molecules. The key physical effect enabling such oxygen abundance measurements is that spectral features in the optical arise from both the CO-dominant and the atomic carbon-dominant regions, providing non-degenerate constraints on both C and O. Beyond the case at hand, the results show that physically sound abundances measurements need not be limited to those elements that have observable lines themselves. "

In this paper, we present a data-driven point cloud upsampling technique. 	The key idea is to learn multi-level features per point and expand the point set via a multi-branch convolution unit implicitly in feature space. The expanded feature is then split to a multitude of features, which are then reconstructed to an upsampled point set. 	Our network is applied at a patch-level, with a joint loss function that encourages the upsampled points to remain on the underlying surface with a uniform distribution. 	We conduct various experiments using synthesis and scan data to evaluate our method and demonstrate its superiority over some baseline methods and an optimization-based method. Results show that our upsampled points have better uniformity and are located closer to the underlying surfaces. "

A similar inequality is given for Legendrian links by using the notions of positive and negative transverse push-off.

1801_07681_paper.tex," A wide variety of optimization techniques, both exact and heuristic, tend to be biased samplers. This means that when attempting to find multiple uncorrelated solutions of a degenerate Boolean optimization problem a subset of the solution space tends to be favored while, in the worst case, some solutions can never be accessed by the used algorithm. Here we present a simple post-processing technique that improves sampling for any optimization approach, either quantum or classical. More precisely, starting from a pool of a few optimal configurations, the algorithm generates potentially new solutions via rejection-free cluster updates at zero temperature. Although the method is not ergodic and there is no guarantee that all the solutions can be found, fair sampling is typically improved. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method by improving the exponentially biased data produced by the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer [Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\bf 118}, 07052 (2017)] , as well as data from three-dimensional Ising spin glasses. As part of the study, we also show that sampling is improved when sub-optimal states are included and discuss sampling at a finite fixed temperature. "
1801_08037_contact.tex," The public collider phenomenology computing tool CheckMATE (Check Models at Terascale Energies) was originally designed to allow theorists to quickly test their favourite BSM models against various existing LHC analyses performed by ATLAS and CMS. It offers an automatised chain of Monte Carlo event generation, detector simulation, event analysis and statistical evaluation so that it can automatically determine whether a given parameter point of a BSM model is excluded or not. Currently, it contains more than 50 individual ATLAS or CMS analyses whose several hundred signal regions target various final states as they typically appear in theories beyond the Standard Model. In this study, we extend this functionality to allow sensitivity studies for the International Linear Collider. As an example, we implement a dark matter monophoton search and use it to analyse three benchmark scenarios with different assumptions about the interaction between dark matter and Standard Model particles. We determine the ILC sensitivity expected for $s = GeV, L_{int} = fb^{-1}$ and compare the results for the cases of completely unpolarised beams and for individual lepton polarisation settings. "

We show that traditional statistical multiplexing does not allow such a low latency, due to collisions and buffering at nodes. Hence, we propose in this article to use a deterministic scheme for sending periodic messages without collisions in the network thus saving the latency incurred by buffering. We give several algorithms to compute such schemes for a common topology where one link is shared by all antennas. We show that there is always a solution when the routes are short or the load is small. When the parameters are unconstrained, and some buffering is allowed in the processing units, we propose an algorithm (PMLS) adapted from a classical scheduling method. The experimental results show that even under full load, most of the time PMLS finds a deterministic sending scheme with no latency. "

1801_03260_Benz.tex," In this paper, we study topological phases in a 2D photonic crystal with broken time ( $T$ ) and parity ( $P$ ) symmetries by performing calculations of band structures, Berry curvatures, Chern numbers, edge states and also numerical simulations of light propagation in the edge modes. Specifically, we consider a hexagonal lattice consisting of triangular gyromagnetic rods. Here the gyromagnetic material breaks $T$ symmetry while the triangular rods breaks $P$ symmetry. Interestingly, we find that the crystal could host quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phases with different gap Chern numbers ( $C_g$ ) including $|C_g| > 1$ as well as quantum valley Hall (QVH) phases with contrasting valley Chern numbers ( $C_v$ ), depending on the orientation of the triangular rods. Furthermore, phase transitions among these topological phases, such as from QAH to QVH and vice versa, can be engineered by a simple rotation of the rods. Our band theoretical analyses reveal that the Dirac nodes at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys in the momentum space are produced and protected by the mirror symmetry ( $m_y$ ) instead of the $P$ symmetry, and they become gapped when either $T$ or $m_y$ symmetry is broken, resulting in a QAH or QVH phase, respectively. Moreover, a high Chern number ( $C_g = -2$ ) QAH phase is generated by gapping triply degenerate nodal points rather than pairs of Dirac points by breaking $T$ symmetry.  Our proposed photonic crystal thus provides a platform for investigating intriguing topological phenomena which may be challenging to realize in electronic systems, and also has promising potentials for device applications in photonics such as reflection-free one-way waveguides and topological photonic circuits.

1801_06144_abstract.tex," Pull-stream is a JavaScript demand-driven functional design pattern based on callback functions that enables the creation and easy composition of independent modules that are used to create streaming applications. It is used in popular open source projects and the community around it has created over a hundred compatible modules. While the description of the pull-stream design pattern may seem simple, it does exhibit complicated termination cases. Despite the popularity and large uptake of the pull-stream design pattern, there was no existing formal specification that could help programmers reason about the correctness of their implementations.  Thus, the main contribution of this paper is to provide a formalization for specifying and implementing correct pull-stream modules based on the following: (1) we show the pull-stream design pattern is a form of declarative concurrent programming; (2) we present an event-based protocol language that supports our formalization, independently of JavaScript; (3) we provide the first precise and explicit definition of the expected sequences of events that happen at the interface of two modules, which we call the pull-stream protocol; (4) we specify reference modules that exhibit the full range of behaviors of the pull-stream protocol; (5) we validate our definitions against the community expectations by testing the existing core pull-stream modules against them and identify unspecified behaviors in existing modules. Our approach helps to better understand the pull-stream protocol, to ensure interoperability of community modules, and to concisely and precisely specify new pull-stream abstractions in papers and documentation.

1801_02950_abstract.tex,"  Malware is constantly adapting in order to avoid detection. Model  based malware detectors, such as SVM and neural networks, are  vulnerable to so-called \textit{adversarial  examples} which are modest changes to detectable malware that allows the resulting malware to evade detection. Continuous-valued methods that are robust to adversarial examples of images have been developed using saddle-point optimization formulations.  We are inspired by them to develop similar methods for the discrete, e.g. binary, domain which characterizes the features of malware. A specific extra challenge of malware is that the adversarial examples must be generated in a way that preserves their malicious functionality. We  introduce methods capable of generating functionally preserved  adversarial malware examples in the binary domain. Using the saddle-point formulation, we incorporate the adversarial examples into the training of models that are robust to them. We evaluate the  effectiveness of the methods and others in the literature on a set of Portable Execution~(PE)  files. Comparison prompts our introduction of an online measure computed during training to assess general expectation of robustness. "
1801_04815_main_manuscript.tex," Learning similarity functions between image pairs with deep neural networks yields highly correlated activations of embeddings. In this work, we show how to improve the robustness of such embeddings by exploiting the independence within ensembles. To this end, we divide the last embedding layer of a deep network into an embedding ensemble and formulate training this ensemble as an online gradient boosting problem. Each learner receives a reweighted training sample from the previous learners. Further, we propose two loss functions which increase the diversity in our ensemble. These loss functions can be applied either for weight initialization or during training. Together, our contributions leverage large embedding sizes more effectively by significantly reducing correlation of the embedding and consequently increase retrieval accuracy of the embedding. Our method works with any differentiable loss function and does not introduce any additional parameters during test time. We evaluate our metric learning method on image retrieval tasks and show that it improves over state-of-the-art methods on the CUB-200-2011, Cars-196, Stanford Online Products, In-Shop Clothes Retrieval and VehicleID datasets.

Moreover, characterizing the social structures of individuals and groups as a hierarchical Bayesian model, we show that a useful description of an individual's moral values -- as well as a group's shared values -- can be inferred from a limited amount of observed data. Finally, we apply and evaluate our approach to data from the Moral Machine, a web application that collects human judgments on moral dilemmas involving autonomous vehicles. "
1801_06970_Manuscript_31Jan2018.tex,"     A simple yet effective numerical method using orthogonal hybrid functions consisting of piecewise constant orthogonal sample-and-hold functions and piecewise linear orthogonal triangular functions is proposed to solve numerically fractional order non-stiff and stiff differential-algebraic equations. The complementary generalized one-shot operational matrices, which are the foundation for the developed numerical method, are derived to estimate the Riemann-Liouville fractional order integral in the new orthogonal hybrid function domain. It is theoretically and numerically shown that the numerical method converges the approximate solutions to the exact solution in the limit of step size tends to zero. Numerical examples are solved using the proposed method and the obtained results are compared with the results of some popular semi-analytical techniques used for solving fractional order differential-algebraic equations in the literature. Our results are in good accordance with the results of those semi-analytical methods in case of non-stiff problems and our method provides valid approximate solution to stiff problem (fractional order version of Chemical Akzo Nobel problem) which those semi-analytical methods failsto solve.

1801_01978_ito_icc18.tex," In this paper, we propose a novel sparse signal recovery algorithm called Trainable ISTA (TISTA). The proposed algorithm consists of two estimation units such as a linear estimation unit  and a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator-based shrinkage unit. The estimated error variance required in the MMSE shrinkage unit is precisely estimated from a tentative estimate of the original signal. The remarkable feature of the proposed scheme is that TISTA includes adjustable variables controlling a step size and the error variance for the MMSE shrinkage. The variables are adjusted by standard deep learning techniques. The number of trainable variables of TISTA is equal to the number of iteration rounds and it is much smaller than that of known learnable sparse signal recovery algorithms. This feature leads to highly stable and fast training processes of TISTA. Computer experiments show that TISTA is applicable to various classes of sensing matrices such as Gaussian matrices, binary matrices and matrices with large condition numbers. Numerical results also demonstrate that TISTA shows significantly faster convergence than those of AMP and LISTA in many cases. "
1801_01356_Roleofhydrogen.tex," We have measured optical absorption in mid-infrared spectral range on hydrogen intercalated epitaxial graphene grown on silicon face of SiC. We have used attenuated total reflection geometry to enhance absorption related to the surface and SiC/graphene interface. The samples of epitaxial graphene have been intercalated in the temperature range of 790 to 1250 $^\circ$ C and compared to the reference samples of hydrogen etched SiC. We have found that although the Si-H bonds form at as low temperatures as 790 $^\circ$ C, the well developed bond order has been reached only for epitaxial graphene intercalated at temperatures exceeding 1000 $^\circ$ C. We also show that the hydrogen intercalation degradates on a time scale of few days when samples are stored in ambient air. The optical spectroscopy shows on a formation of vinyl and silyl functional groups on the SiC/graphene interface due to the residual atomic hydrogen left from the intercalation process. "

These effects may be described using a multipole expansion of the clustering measurements. Focussing on Fourier-space statistics, we present a new analysis of the effect of the survey window function, and the variation of the line-of-sight across a survey, on the modelling of power spectrum multipoles. We determine the joint covariance of the Fourier-space multipoles in a Gaussian approximation, and indicate how these techniques may be extended to studies of overlapping galaxy populations via multipole cross-power spectra. We apply our methodology to one of the widest-area galaxy redshift surveys currently available, the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey, deducing a normalized growth rate $f \sigma_8 = 0.38 \pm 0.12$ in the low-redshift Universe, in agreement with previous analyses of this dataset using different techniques.

We study the matter bispectrum of large scale structure as a probe of these modified gravity theories, focusing in particular on the effect of the terms that newly appear in the so-called ``beyond Horndeski'' theories. We derive the second-order solution for the matter density perturbations and find that the interactions beyond Horndeski lead to a new time-dependent coefficient in the second-order kernel which differs in general from the standard value of general relativity and the Horndeski theory. This can deform the matter bispectrum at the folded triangle configurations ( $k_1+k_2=k_3$ ), while it is never possible within the Horndeski theory. "
1801_01106.tex," A graph $\G$ of even order is a {\em bicirculant} if it admits an automorphism with two orbits of equal length. Symmetry properties of bicirculants, for which at least one of the induced subgraphs on the two orbits of the corresponding semiregular automorphism is a cycle, have been studied, at least for the few smallest possible valences. For valences $3$ , $4$ and $5$ , where the corresponding bicirculants are called generalized Petersen graphs, Rose window graphs and Taba \v cjn graphs, respectively, all edge-transitive members have been classified. While there are only 7 edge-transitive generalized Petersen graphs and only 3 edge-transitive Taba \v cjn graphs, infinite families of edge-transitive Rose window graphs exist. The main theme of this paper is the question of the existence of such bicirculants for higher valences. It is proved that infinite families of edge-transitive examples of valence $6$ exist and among them infinitely many arc-transitive as well as infinitely many half-arc-transitive members are identified. Moreover, the classification of the ones of valence $6$ and girth $3$ is given. As a corollary, an infinite family of half-arc-transitive graphs of valence $6$ with universal reachability relation, which were thus far not known to exist, is obtained. "

We find that for different values of parameters the quark and diquark current contribute to the EMFFs of $\Lambda_c$ is very different, but the total contribute to the EMFFs of $\Lambda_c$ is similarly. The EMFFs of $\Lambda_c$ are similar to those of other baryons (proton, $\Xi^-$ , $\Sigma^+$ ) with a peak at $\omega =1$ ( $\omega=v^\prime \cdot v $ is the velocity transfer between the initial state (with velocity $v$ ) and the final state (with velocity $v^\prime$ ) of $\Lambda_c$ ).

1801_09682_halo_shape_paper.tex," We employ isolated N-body simulations to study the response of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos in the presence of the baryonic potentials. Dark matter self-interactions lead to kinematic thermalization in the inner halo, resulting in a tight correlation between the dark matter and baryon distributions. A deep baryonic potential shortens the phase of SIDM core expansion and triggers core contraction. This effect can be further enhanced by a large self-scattering cross section. We find the final SIDM density profile is sensitive to the baryonic concentration and the strength of dark matter self-interactions. Assuming a spherical initial halo, we also study evolution of the SIDM halo shape together with the density profile. The halo shape at later epochs deviates from spherical symmetry due to the influence of the non-spherical disk potential, and its significance depends on the baryonic contribution to the total gravitational potential, relative to the dark matter one. In addition, we construct a multi-component model for the Milky Way, including an SIDM halo, a stellar disk and a bulge, and show it is consistent with observations from stellar kinematics and streams.

1801_07063_draftMGMM.tex," In the framework of model-based clustering, a model allowing several latent class variables is proposed. This model assumes that the distribution of the observed data can be factorized into several independent blocks of variables. Each block is assumed to follow a latent class model ( {\it i.e.,} mixture with conditional independence assumption). The proposed model includes variable selection, as a special case, and is able to cope with the mixed-data setting. The simplicity of the model allows to estimate the repartition of the variables into blocks and the mixture parameters simultaneously, thus avoiding to run EM algorithms for each possible repartition of variables into blocks. For the proposed method, a model is defined by the number of blocks, the number of clusters inside each block and the repartition of variables into block. Model selection can be done with two information criteria, the BIC and the MICL, for which an efficient optimization is proposed. The performances of the model are investigated on simulated and real data. It is shown that the proposed method gives a rich interpretation of the dataset at hand ( {\it i.e.,} analysis of the repartition of the variables into blocks and analysis of the clusters produced by each block of variables).

The equation can also be written as $\rho \Delta V = T \Delta S - p \Delta V$ by regarding the energy-momentum tensor as that of a fluid. "
1801_02242_manuscript.tex," With a statistical measure of distance, we derive a classical uncertainty relation for processes traversing nonequilibrium states both transiently and irreversibly. This relationship stems from the link between the Fisher information and an entropic acceleration. Our measure of uncertainty is a lower bound for the rate of change in the entropy production and flow, which in turn can be interpreted as an average local change in information. The consequences of these results are that while the uncertainty about the nonstationary path to equilibrium (or steady states) is generally positive, there exists paths with a constant entropic acceleration and zero uncertainty. These findings demonstrate that the shortest distance to equilibrium does not necessarily correlate with the uncertainty about the path taken by the system. For example, in a driven version of Onsager's three-state model, we show that a set of high-uncertainty initial-conditions, some of which are near equilibrium, scar the state space. "

1801_02222_dopants-in-2dim.tex," Since the 1998 proposal to build a quantum computer using dopants in semiconductors as qubits, much progress has been achieved on semiconductors nano fabrication and control of charge and spins in single dopants. However, an important problem remains, which is the control at the atomic scale of the dopants positioning. We propose to circumvent this problem by using 2 dimensional materials as hosts. Since the first isolation of graphene in 2004, the number of new 2D materials with favorable properties for electronics has been growing. Dopants in 2 dimensional systems are more tightly bound and potentially easier to position and manipulate. Considering the properties of currently available 2D materials, we access the feasibility of such proposal in terms of the manipulability of isolated dopants (for single qubit operations) and dopant pairs (for two qubit operations). Our results indicate that a wide variety of 2D materials may perform at least as well as the currently studied bulk host for donor qubits. "
1801_07591_OneShot.tex," A minimally-invasive way to detect the presence of a stealth target is to probe it with a single photon and analyze the reflected signals. The efficiency of such a conventional detection scheme can potentially be enhanced by the method of quantum illumination, where entanglement is exploited to break the classical limits. The question is, what is the optimal quantum state that allows us to achieve the detection limit with a minimal error? Here we address this question for discrete signals, by deriving a complete and general set of analytic solutions for the whole parameter space, which can be classified into three distinct regions, in the form of ``phase diagrams"" for both conventional and quantum illumination. Interestingly, whenever the reflectivity of the target is less than some critical values, all received signals become useless, which is true even if entangled resources are employed. However, there does exist a region where quantum illumination can provide advantages over conventional illumination; there, the optimal signal state is an entangled state with an entanglement spectrum inversely proportional to the spectrum of the environmental state. These results not only impose fundamental limits in applications such as quantum radars, but also suggest how to become immune against the attack of minimally-invasive detection. "
ms.tex," Computer-aided early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and its prodromal form, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), has been the subject of extensive research in recent years. Some recent studies have shown promising results in the AD and MCI determination using structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI, fMRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) modalities. Furthermore, fusion of imaging modalities in a supervised machine learning framework has shown promising direction of research.  In this paper we first review major trends in automatic classification methods such as feature extraction based methods as well as deep learning approaches in medical image analysis applied to the field of Alzheimer's Disease diagnostics. Then we propose our own algorithm for Alzheimer's Disease diagnostics based on a convolutional neural network and sMRI and DTI modalities fusion on hippocampal ROI using data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database ( http://adni.loni.usc.edu ). Comparison with a single modality approach shows promising results. We also propose our own method of data augmentation for balancing classes of different size and analyze the impact of the ROI size on the classification results as well. 	 "
