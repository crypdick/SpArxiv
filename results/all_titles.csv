		\thanks{This work has received support under the program “LABEX MS2T” launched by the French Government and implemented by ANR with the references ANR-11-IDEX-0004-02.
		This is an author version. The final publication is available at Springer via \url{https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-67582-4_2}. The text of this version is identical to the final publication, except for this footnote, a few corrected typos, and a rephrasing of the very last paragraph (page \pageref{epistemic}).
		\textbf{Erratum}: in the first paragraph of \cref{sec:mcdm}, contrary to what has been written, the points of view are not necessarily represented by weak-orders. This is illustrated in \cref{ex:electre} where the relation $C$ may violate transitivity (consider $x_1 = (2, 0, 1)$, $x_2 = (1, 2, 0)$ and $x_3 = (0, 1, 2)$).}
